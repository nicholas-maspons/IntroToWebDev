    <!-- Place your Nav Links Here -->

      <!-- use UL LI and A for Nav Links within our NAV tag -->
      <ul>
        <!-- "#" vs index.html
        "#"" takes me to the top of the page
        "index.html" takes me to that page (which is this one, so it essentially refreshes it)
        Since this isn't a long page, the dummy link seems to do the same thing.
        However, on a longer page (contact.html), "#" would scroll (more of a teleport) to the top,
        while "index.html" would still refresh (which ofc takes you to the top as well [in this scenario. Remember ids can be used to jump to certain parts of the page]).
        and if you look closely, the tab handle refreshes with "index.html"
        but doesn't with "#"-->
        <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
