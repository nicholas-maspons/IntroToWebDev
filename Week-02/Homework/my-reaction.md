Wireframing is a valuable and essential skill in website design. It provides a clear starting point for discussions among different teams, as they don't require any specific expertise to understand. Wireframes help ensure that everyone is on the same page and provide the opportunity for people to ask questions early on.

This minimizes the amount of time wasted, which of course is very important.
