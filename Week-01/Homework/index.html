        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place butter in a pan and heat it. Move the pan around so that the melted butter coats the entire surface. This helps prevent the eggs from sticking. (Disclaimer: They can still stick to your pan)
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the pan is coated with melted butter, crack the eggs into the pan separately, keeping the yolks intact. Let the eggs cook.
            </li>
            <li>
                Toast the bread slices, but remove them so that they are slightly toasted with a bit of crunch.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut the avocado in half and spread half of the avocado on each slice of bread. 
            </li>
            <li>
                By now, the eggs should be ready to flip. If they don't move easily, let them cook a bit longer. When ready, use a spatula to separate the egg whites if they've joined forces, then flip them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let the eggs cook for just under a minute. Once done, place them on top of the avocado-coated bread slices. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add salt, pepper, and honey. Or don't.
            </li>
            <li>
                You are done.
            </li>
        </ol>
