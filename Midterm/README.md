Why did I make this?
- Because I just like keeping track of these things. I find it interesting. I looked at apps like MyFitnessPal and Cronometer, but they have too many features for my liking. They are primarily for weight loss but I just want to input data and see it in graphs. Also, if I just make my own website or app, I will then have premium because I own it.
